# The Spine (Fixed Datum)

## How to read this
- This page is the **trunk** of the Paton System.
- It does not change between fields.
- Field pages may interpret this structure, but **may not rewrite it**.
- Rule: **If maths is used, it must be explained in plain language.**

---

## I. Solidified Datum (Non-Negotiable)

Before any model, equation, optimisation, prediction, or explanation is allowed to operate,  
the description itself must be **admissible** and **viable** under constraint.

The Paton System is not a competing physical theory.  
It is a **permission framework**: it determines what is allowed to count as explanation at all.

---

## II. Core Structural Invariants (BRP)

A description is admissible if and only if all three conditions hold:

### 1. Boundary
- The system being described has a defined scope.
- Concepts are not smeared across incompatible domains.

### 2. Relation
- Variables or elements are meaningfully related.
- Correlation is not mistaken for structure.

### 3. Persistence
- The description can continue across time, scale, or recursion.
- If persistence collapses, continuation halts.

**Failure of any one condition stops progression.**

---

## III. Admissibility Before Dynamics

- No dynamics, optimisation, or prediction is permitted before admissibility.
- Explanation is gated before motion.

This ordering is strict.

---

## IV. Non-Interference Rule

The Paton System:
- Adds **no new physical forces**
- Infers **no intent**
- Performs **no optimisation**

It only permits or forbids continuation based on structure.

---

## V. Tier Architecture (Ordering Only)

The tiers describe **structural order**, not metaphysical claims.

- Tier 0 — Availability (lookability)
- Tier 1 — Distinction (boundary)
- Tier 2 — Constrained flow
- Tier 3 — Static admissibility (PAT / Eye of the Needle)
- Tier 4 — Observer / expression interface
- Tier 5 — Mechanism layer
- Tier 6 — Viability
- Tier 7 — Continuation or termination
- Tier 8 — Structural ceiling

---

## VI. Mechanism Layer (Shared Form)

### Canonical Paton Recursion

Pₙ = Cₙ · (Pₙ₋₁ + Pₙ₋₂)

**Plain meaning:**  
The next viable state arises from retained structure, shaped by current constraint.

- The **form** of the recursion never changes.
- The **interpretation** is field-specific.

---

## VII. Branching Rule

Only **interpretation** branches — never structure.

Each field must specify locally:
- what counts as a boundary
- what counts as a relation
- how persistence is measured
- where failure is observed

---

## VIII. Mandatory Field Anchor

Every derived page or paper must include:

> This document is a projection of the Paton System under the constraints of **[FIELD NAME]**.  
> The datum, invariants, and tier ordering remain unchanged.

---

## One-Line Summary

The Paton System does not explain how systems behave.  
It determines whether explanations are allowed to behave at all.
