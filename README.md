# The Paton System
**Admissibility and viability before dynamics**

A structural admissibility framework for determining when models are permitted to operate.

---

## Overview

The Paton System is a pre-theoretical framework for evaluating whether a description, model, or explanation is structurally permitted to proceed before equations, optimisation, or prediction are applied.

It provides a domain-neutral architecture for admissibility across mathematical, physical, and conceptual systems.

The framework does not replace domain-specific theory.  
It determines whether such models are structurally permitted to operate.

## Structural Principle

This repository presents a fixed spine with branched field interpretations:

- The spine remains invariant  
- Branches elaborate only where required  
- All domains inherit identical admissibility conditions
