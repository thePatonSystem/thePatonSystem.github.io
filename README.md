# The Paton System
Admissibility and viability before dynamics.

A structural framework for determining when models are permitted to operate.

---

## Overview

The Paton System is a pre-theoretical architecture for evaluating whether a description, model, or explanation is structurally permitted to proceed before equations, optimisation, or prediction are applied.

It provides a domain-neutral admissibility structure applicable across mathematical, physical, and conceptual systems.

The framework does not replace domain-specific theory or physical law.  
It determines whether such models are structurally permitted to operate.

## Structural Principle

The repository presents a fixed spine with branched field interpretations.

The spine remains invariant.  
Branches elaborate only where required.  
All domains inherit identical admissibility conditions.
