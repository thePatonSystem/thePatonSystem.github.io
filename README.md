# The Paton System
**Admissibility and viability before dynamics.**

The Paton System is a pre-theoretical framework for determining whether a description, model, or explanation is *allowed to proceed* before equations, optimisation, or prediction are applied.

Formal classification framework for admissibility across domains.  
The framework is archived with DOI registration and version control via Zenodo.

## Structure
This site is organised as a **fixed spine with branched field interpretations**.

- The spine does not move  
- Branches elaborate only when necessary  
- All fields inherit the same admissibility rules
