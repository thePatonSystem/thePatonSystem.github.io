# The Paton System

**Admissibility and viability before dynamics.**

The Paton System is a pre-theoretical framework for determining  
whether a description, model, or explanation is *allowed to proceed*  
before equations, optimisation, or prediction are applied.

## Structure
This site is organised as a **fixed spine with branched field interpretations**.

- The spine does not move  
- Branches elaborate only when necessary  
- All fields inherit the same admissibility rules
