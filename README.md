# The Paton System
**Admissibility and viability before dynamics**

*A structural admissibility framework for determining when models are permitted to operate.*

The Paton System is a pre-theoretical framework for determining whether a description, model, or explanation is structurally permitted to proceed before equations, optimisation, or prediction are applied.

It provides a formal classification architecture for admissibility across domains.

Philosophy of Science • Systems Theory • Structural Modelling

## Scope
The Paton System evaluates **structural admissibility conditions only.**  
It does **not** replace domain-specific theory or physical law; it determines whether such models are structurally permitted to operate.

## Structure
This site is organised as a **fixed spine with branched field interpretations**.

- The spine remains invariant  
- Branches elaborate only where required  
- All domains inherit identical admissibility conditions
